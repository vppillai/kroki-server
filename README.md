  <strong>Note:</strong><br>
  While the initial framework and specifications were manually crafted, over <strong>90%</strong> of the code in this repository was generated using AI tools. As such, the code quality and structure may not fully reflect best practices and have not undergone extensive manual review.<br><br>
  That said, I have been actively <em>dogfooding</em> the tool, and it is functional and working as intended in real-world usage.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/vppillai/kroki-server.git
cd kroki-server

# Start the server
./setup-kroki-server.sh start

# Access the demo site (default port)
# Default: https://localhost:8443/
# Port configurable in .env file

# Test the configured endpoint
./setup-kroki-server.sh health
```

## Overview

This project provides a complete solution for running a [Kroki](https://kroki.io/) diagram rendering server locally. It includes:

- A Docker Compose setup for running the Kroki server and its dependencies
- An interactive demo site for creating and previewing diagrams
- HTTPS support via self-signed certificates
- Configurable ports via environment variables (.env file)
- Comprehensive deployment scripts and utilities

## Configuration

### Port Configuration

The server ports can be configured through the `.env` file (single values only):

```bash
HTTP_PORT=8000                  # Kroki core server port
HTTPS_PORT=8443                 # Nginx HTTPS proxy port
DEMOSITE_CONTAINER_PORT=8006    # Demo site internal port
HOSTNAME=localhost              # Hostname for SSL certificate and CORS
```

### Changing Ports:
1. Edit the `.env` file with your desired port numbers:
   - `HTTP_PORT=8000` and `HTTPS_PORT=8443`
2. Restart the services: `./setup-kroki-server.sh restart`
3. Access the site at: `https://{hostname}:{HTTPS_PORT}/`

**Example**:
- `https://localhost:8443/`

**Note**: After changing ports, the Nginx configuration and Docker Compose override files are automatically regenerated to use the new port settings.

### Docker Compose Override System

The server uses a dynamic Docker Compose override system for port management:

#### How It Works
- **Automatic Generation**: `docker-compose.override.yml` is automatically created based on `.env` configuration
- **Dynamic Port Mapping**: The configured port is mapped automatically
- **Git Ignored**: Override files are excluded from version control (added to `.gitignore`)
- **Template Available**: `docker-compose.override.yml.template` provides a reference example

#### Example Generated Override
```yaml
# docker-compose.override.yml (auto-generated)
services:
  nginx:
    ports:
      - "8443:8443"
  core:
    ports:
      - "8000:8000"
```

### Security and CORS

The server includes CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) configuration:

#### Multi-Origin Support
- **Dynamic Whitelist**: Automatically generates CORS whitelist from all hostname/port combinations
- **Secure by Default**: Only configured hostnames and ports are allowed
- **Development Friendly**: Includes common localhost variants for development
- **Production Ready**: Strict origin validation for production deployments

#### CORS Configuration
All combinations of configured hostnames and HTTPS ports are automatically whitelisted:
- `https://localhost:8443`, `https://localhost:9443`, `https://localhost:10443`
- `https://127.0.0.1:8443`, `https://127.0.0.1:9443`, `https://127.0.0.1:10443`
- `https://kroki.local:8443`, `https://kroki.local:9443`, `https://kroki.local:10443`

### Health Monitoring System

Comprehensive health monitoring for all configured endpoints:

#### Health Check Features
- **Multi-Endpoint Testing**: Tests all hostname/port combinations automatically
- **Detailed Reporting**: Shows success/failure status for each endpoint
- **Summary Statistics**: Provides overview of healthy vs failed endpoints
- **Optional Execution**: Health checks are available on-demand, not run automatically
- **Fast Execution**: Configurable timeouts for quick assessment

#### Usage
```bash
# Run comprehensive health checks
./setup-kroki-server.sh health

# Example output:
# Testing https://localhost:8443... ✓ OK
# Testing https://localhost:9443... ✓ OK
# Testing https://localhost:10443... ✓ OK
# Testing https://127.0.0.1:8443... ✓ OK
# Testing https://127.0.0.1:9443... ✓ OK
# Testing https://127.0.0.1:10443... ✓ OK
# Testing https://kroki.local:8443... ✗ FAILED
# Testing https://kroki.local:9443... ✗ FAILED
# Testing https://kroki.local:10443... ✗ FAILED
#
# Health Check Summary:
#   Total endpoints tested: 9
#   Successful: 6
#   Failed: 3
#   Status: Some endpoints failed ✗
```

### AI Assistant Configuration

The demo site includes an integrated AI assistant for diagram creation and modification:

- **Core Kroki**: Main service that coordinates diagram rendering
- **Renderers**: Specialized containers for different diagram types
- **Demo Site**: Custom UI for creating and previewing diagrams

## Deployment

### Requirements

- Docker
- Docker Compose
- Bash shell

### Setup Options

The [`setup-kroki-server.sh`](setup-kroki-server.sh) script provides several commands:

```bash
# Start the server
./setup-kroki-server.sh start

# Stop the server
./setup-kroki-server.sh stop

# Restart the server
./setup-kroki-server.sh restart

# Clean up all containers and data
./setup-kroki-server.sh clean

# View the container logs
./setup-kroki-server.sh logs

# Check container status
./setup-kroki-server.sh status

# Run health checks on all configured endpoints
./setup-kroki-server.sh health

# Get help information
./setup-kroki-server.sh help
```

### Custom Hostname

By default, the server uses `localhost`. You can specify a custom hostname:

```bash
./setup-kroki-server.sh start --hostname your-domain.com
```

### Custom SSL Certificates

You can provide your own SSL certificates:

```bash
./setup-kroki-server.sh start --cert path/to/cert.crt --key path/to/key.key
```

### Health Monitoring

The health monitoring system provides comprehensive testing of all configured server endpoints:

#### Running Health Checks

```bash
# Test all configured hostname/port combinations
./setup-kroki-server.sh health
```

#### Health Check Output

The health command tests every combination of hostnames and HTTPS ports defined in your `.env` file:

```
Testing https://localhost:8443... ✓ OK
Testing https://localhost:9443... ✓ OK  
Testing https://localhost:10443... ✓ OK
Testing https://127.0.0.1:8443... ✓ OK
Testing https://127.0.0.1:9443... ✓ OK
Testing https://127.0.0.1:10443... ✓ OK
Testing https://kroki.local:8443... ✗ FAILED
Testing https://kroki.local:9443... ✗ FAILED
Testing https://kroki.local:10443... ✗ FAILED

Health Check Summary:
  Total endpoints tested: 9
  Successful: 6
  Failed: 3
  Status: Some endpoints failed ✗
```

#### When to Use Health Checks

- **After Configuration Changes**: Verify new ports and hostnames are working
- **Deployment Verification**: Confirm all endpoints are accessible after deployment
- **Network Troubleshooting**: Identify which hostname/port combinations have issues
- **Load Balancer Testing**: Verify all configured endpoints for load balancing setups
- **Security Auditing**: Ensure only intended endpoints are accessible

#### Health Check Features

- **Fast Execution**: Concurrent testing with configurable timeouts (5s connect, 10s total)
- **Detailed Reporting**: Individual endpoint status plus summary statistics
- **Exit Codes**: Returns 0 for all healthy, 1 for any failures (useful in scripts)
- **SSL Support**: Tests HTTPS endpoints with certificate validation bypass for self-signed certs
- **Network Resilience**: Handles network timeouts and connection failures gracefully

## How It Works

1. The user writes diagram code in the editor
2. The code is compressed and encoded using deflate and base64
3. A request is sent to the Kroki server
4. The appropriate renderer container processes the diagram
5. The result is returned to the browser and displayed

## Development

### Demo Site Structure

The demo site is built with a modular architecture for maintainability and extensibility:

- [`demoSite/index.html`](demoSite/index.html) - Main HTML structure with responsive layout
- [`demoSite/js/main.js`](demoSite/js/main.js) - Core application initialization and coordination
- [`demoSite/js/config.js`](demoSite/js/config.js) - Configuration definitions and defaults
- [`demoSite/js/config-ui.js`](demoSite/js/config-ui.js) - Settings interface and user preferences
- [`demoSite/js/modules/`](demoSite/js/modules/) - Modular JavaScript components:
  - `state.js` - Application state management
  - `constants.js` - Application constants and defaults
  - `configuration.js` - Configuration system integration
  - `fileOperations.js` - File handling and monitoring with auto-reload
  - `urlHandler.js` - URL parameter processing
  - `diagramOperations.js` - Diagram rendering and format management
  - `utils.js` - Utility functions and helpers
  - `theme.js` - Theme management and dark/light mode
  - `zoomPan.js` - Interactive image viewing controls
  - `fullscreen.js` - Fullscreen mode functionality
  - `search.js` - Code search and navigation
- [`demoSite/css/`](demoSite/css/) - Modular CSS with theme support
- [`demoSite/examples/`](demoSite/examples/) - Example diagram code for each format

### Key Implementation Features

- **Modular Architecture**: Clean separation of concerns with ES6 modules
- **State Management**: Centralized application state with reactive updates  
- **Configuration System**: Comprehensive settings with real-time application
- **File Monitoring**: Auto-reload functionality with configurable delays (500-5000ms)
- **URL Processing**: Initialization order for proper parameter handling
- **Error Handling**: Robust error management with user-friendly feedback
- **Performance Optimization**: Debounced updates and efficient rendering

### Nginx Configuration

The Nginx proxy handles routing and SSL:

- Routes diagram requests to the core Kroki server
- Serves the demo site static files
- Manages SSL certificates

### Docker Compose Configuration

The [`docker-compose.yml`](docker-compose.yml) file defines the container relationships and networking.

## Debugging

### Common Issues

1. **Certificate Errors**: The default setup uses self-signed certificates, which will trigger browser warnings. Add an exception or provide trusted certificates.

2. **Port Conflicts**: If the default HTTPS port (8443) is already in use, you can change it in the `.env` file:
   ```bash
   # Edit .env file
   HTTPS_PORT=9443  # or any other available port
   ```

3. **Container Issues**: Check logs for more details if any service fails to start.

### Useful Debug Commands

```bash
# List status of docker compose images
docker-compose ps

# Get the demosite logs
docker-compose logs demosite

# Get logs for the core Kroki service
docker-compose logs core

# List networks
docker network list

# Inspect the Kroki network
docker network inspect kroki-server_kroki_network
```

## Quick Reference

### Auto-reload Configuration
1. Open Settings (⚙️ gear icon)
2. Navigate to Advanced → Editor Settings  
3. Adjust "Auto-reload Monitoring Delay" slider (500-5000ms)
4. Enable auto-reload toggle in the toolbar
5. Changes apply immediately to active file monitoring

### URL Parameter Usage
- **Format-only URLs**: `https://localhost:{HTTPS_PORT}/?format=plantuml` (loads PlantUML with default example)
- **Full URLs**: `https://localhost:{HTTPS_PORT}/?format=svg&diag=mermaid&im=encoded_content`
- **Smart defaults**: Invalid format combinations automatically use supported alternatives

*Note: Replace {HTTPS_PORT} with your configured port (default: 8443)*
